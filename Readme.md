# Comparing different Browser automation frameworks

- How simple is it to get going
- How to switch between headless / gui visible
- How to select UI elements by id, css, xpath, title, placeholder, label
    - Especially if I don't care what exactly it is (button/ link), textfield/input/ custom?
- How to express complex search queries (class + text, multiple classes)
- custom wait times
- How to assert information in the page
- How to send return to textfields to trigger form submit handlers
- How to deal with autowaiting? Page did load, js / updating pages, especially with compound search terms (within x, within y, find z)
